# Fishing Logbook
This is a Sinatra application that allows users to sign up, create logbooks to keep track of species, location, weather, moon phases, and date relative to a catch. In future implementations this could be used as a crowd sourced data gathering app for marine biology for tracking shark migrations or lionfish infestation.

## Usage

To use this app, just clone, run `bundle install`, run `rake db:migrate` and then run `shotgun`.
Everything should be set up.
